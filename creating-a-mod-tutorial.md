# Tutorial :: Creating a mod


## Create a C# project
* Open your IDE (VS/XS) and create a new C# class library project.
* The name of your mod is name of this project. The mod name should be unique, so see the mod list already created here: 
* In the properties/options of the project change the target framework to .NET 3.5
* Opent the .csproj file in a text editor and add the line bellow after this line:
  <Import Project="$(MSBuildBinPath)\Microsoft.CSharp.targets" />
  <Import Project="..\msbuilds\Buildron.ClassicMods.targets" />
* In the project references, add the reference to:
	* UnityEngine.dll
	* Buildron.Sdk.dll
	* Skahal.Unity.Scripts.dll
	* Skahal.Unity.Scripts.Externals.dll
* In the root namespace add a class called Mod that implements IMod inteface.


* If your mod has assets, then  you need to create an Unity project too. Open Unity3d and create a new project with the same name you give to the c# class library project.
* In Edit / Project settings / Editor
* * Version control mode, select "Visible Meta Files"
* * Assert serialization mode, select "Force Text"
* Change your msbuild to copy your .dlls to your  Assets/references folder.
